Jazz: As a core application the user chooses how they are feeling (a mood) as soon as they enter the website, 
      and based on the mood selection a song playlist is generated. Using Spotifys API call the user will get 
      songs base off the selected Mood. The Application is writen in Nodejs and React.



Implementation and Discrpiton of Compoments


Compoments:
Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation.


App.js :
  The App component renders first all other tags that are used in it are imported
  The constructor initializes the state of the component. Whenever the state changes
  The component re renders and the change is in effect immediately.
  State - React's way of defining what happens when a component changes its View
  for example - a button when clicked might change its state from logged out to logged in.
